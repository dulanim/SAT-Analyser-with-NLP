The bank client must be able to deposit an amount to and withdraw an amount from his or her accounts using the bank application. Each transaction must be 
recorded, and the client must have the ability to review all transactions performed against a given
 account. Recorded transactions must include the date, time, transaction type, amount and account
 balance after the transaction. A bank client can have two types of accounts. A
checking_account and a saving_account. For each checking account, one related saving-account can
 exists. The application must verify that a client can gain access to his or her account by identification via
 a personal identification number (PIN) code. Neither a checking-account nor a saving-account can
 have a negative balance. The application should automatically withdraw funds from a related saving account 
if the requested withdrawal amount on the checking-account is more than its current balance. If
the saving_account balance is insufficient to cover the requested withdrawal amount, the application should
 inform the user and terminate the transaction.
